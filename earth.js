Descriptions for the different textures used to render the Earth.

earthMapColored:
This map is a synthesis between my original earth map, gradient mapping of the USGS DEM information, hand painting, DEM modulation of detail, bathyspheric depth information, and the USGS Ocean clip. Bathyspheric data was used to modulate the color of the water so that deeper areas are a darker blue than shallow areas.

earthMapBumped:
This is pieced together exclusively from the USGS DEM database. It contains landmass elevations only, with the ocean at zero, and the top of Mt. Everest at 255. Use this as a bump map to give the appearance of the Earth's rugged surface features. Some madmen have also used this data in POV Ray as a displacement map on a very finely divided sphere to produce a "true" 3D version of the Earth. The 10K version is VERY large, so make sure you really need that much detail.

earthMapLights:
1024 x 512 color image. Very similar to the night lights map as published by NASA on their Blue Marble Page. I took their 30000 x 15000 black and white city lights map, and adapted it with a color table to a colorized version of my earth color map. This comes in 2k, 4k, and 10k versions in color, as opposed to the maximum 2k size of the NASA version of this map (higher resolution versions are available on the paid page only because of their size). Be sure to have a look at the tutorials page for a special rendering tip for using this map.
